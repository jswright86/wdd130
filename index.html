         <p>Hello, My name is Joshua Wright and I'm from San Antonio, Texas USA. I am a husband and father of 5 children. I am studying software development through BYU online and love it.
            I'm really excited to learn more about web development throughout this course. Something interesting about me is thgat I currently own a custom cabinet business and really enjoy it, 
            but would rather do something less physicaly demanding for a living but still do it very much as a hobby.</p>
